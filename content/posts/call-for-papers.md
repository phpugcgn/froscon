We invite everyone that wants to present a talk in the PHP room of [FrOSCon](https://froscon.org) on August 5th this year 
to submit a talk in our call for papers. The submission deadline is the 30th of June 
and we will make our acceptance decisions and send out notifications on July 3rd.
You can submit your talk by registering on [frab](https://frab.froscon.org/) 
(make sure to check your spam folder for the registration confirmation) 
and clicking on the "Participate" button for the PHP Conference.

Please provide an accurate and brief description of the contents of your talk
and make sure that your talk is no longer than 45 minutes, to ensure that there 
is enough time for questions at the end and preparations for the next talk. 
You can choose whether you want to give your talk in german or english language.

The PHP sub-conference is a free event organized by the PHP usergroup Cologne/Bonn. 
As such travel or accommodation are not reimbursed.

The [Code of Conduct](https://froscon.org/faq/coc/) from the FrOSCon applies to our PHP room as well. 

If you have any questions, you can contact [katharina@tideways-gmbh.com](mailto:katharina@tideways-gmbh.com)
