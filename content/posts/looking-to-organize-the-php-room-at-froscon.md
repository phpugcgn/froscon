We are looking to organize the PHP room at the Free and Open-Source Conference
(FrOSCon) in Sankt Augustin, Germany on this years 5./6. August 2023.

Once we know that our project proposal is accepted by the FrOSCon organization
team, we will immediately launch a short call for papers and talk proposals.

Please follow [@phpugcgn](https://twitter.com/phpugcgn) to keep up to date with the call for papers
or re-visit this page in a few days/weeks.
